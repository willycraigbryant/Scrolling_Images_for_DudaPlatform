# Scrolling_Images_for_DudaPlatform
Scrolling images from left to right on a screen for Duda web design platform.  

This is simply a program that makes a foundation for displaying scrolling images on the Duda web design platform. 
You put the ID of the image you want ot use in "id=(number)".
(You have to place the image somewhere else on the web page first to right click and edfit HTML. That is where the image ID will be.)
I also give each scrolling image in the code a class name so they can be esily edited in CSS to change size, location, and more.

This code is free for anyone to use! Hope it helps, it took a little bit to figure this out. Duda does not have a widget 
that can do something like this.

If you know of an easier to do this please let me know;D
